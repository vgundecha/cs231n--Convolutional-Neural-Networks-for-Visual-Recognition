# cs231n--Convolutional-Neural-Networks-for-Visual-Recognition

This repository contains code for the Stanford University course on CNNs.
Here's the webpage for the course: http://cs231n.github.io/

Note:
I have copied each ipython notebook in the assingment to a separate script by the name 'ipynbname_main'. For eg., the complete code for the svm notebook is inside svm_main
