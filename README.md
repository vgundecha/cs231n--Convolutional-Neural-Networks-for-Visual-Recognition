# cs231n--Convolutional-Neural-Networks-for-Visual-Recognition

This repository contains code for the Stanford University course on CNNs.
Here's the webpage for the course: http://cs231n.github.io/

Updates:
Assignment 1 of the course has been uploaded in the folder prog1.
Here's the link for the assignment: http://cs231n.github.io/assignments2016/assignment1/

If you are unable to run the get_datasets shell script, just download the CIFAR-10 dataset from: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-python.tar.gz

Note:
I have copied each ipython notebook in the assingment to a separate script by the name 'ipynbname_main'. For eg., the complete code for the svm notebook is inside svm_main
